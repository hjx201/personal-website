# personal-website
Files to create a personal website to eventually deploy online -- started this recently as a summer hobby and an excuse to practice React and webdev in general.

## Goals
- the site will include multiple pages to showcase my resume and an About Me and other things
- the site will have more interactivity on it so I can learn how to use useStates and useEffects in React
- the site will be animated and pretty
- the site will utilize some kind of API for some features
- the site will have some kind of documentation and testing pipeline

So far the site doesn't have much on it -- only a header and a navbar, but my goal is to get it to a presentable level by mid-late August. Will also do my best to keep a log of what is updated each day.

## NPM Targets
- npm start: runs the project
- npm install: builds all the dependencies.
- (more to be added)
